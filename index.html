            <p class="text" >After coaching Crossfit for roughly 8 years I wanted to try and change up my overall career focus. Though I love coaching I wanted to challenge myself to learn something that is very foreign and new to me. That is why I am here. When I entered the Georgia Tech BootCamp I had zero working knowledge of anything I was getting into, and though that was terrifying it was also very intriguing. I am giving myself a chance to grow and struggle and I believe I will be much better for it in the end. I believe that my years spent as a coach will help me communicate with others and give and receive criticism in an effective manner. I really enjoy working with others and look forward to get started on some cool and fun projects.</p>

            <p class="text">Outside of jumping headfirst into uncharted territory, I find that the things I enjoy most are very simple. I like to spend time with my wife who is a bada$$ nurse. We have two "classy ladies" (senior dogs) who we are very grateful have kept happy and healthy through the years. We will go and hike and be adventurous but we will also spend hours at home cooking and watching netflix. Though I would call myself a homebody I do like to go and hangout with friends either at someones house, a restaurant, brewery, park, maybe even playing some tennis or golf (sports I suck at, but enjoy sucking at).  </p>
